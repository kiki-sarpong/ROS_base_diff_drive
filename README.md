# ROS_base_diff_drive
This is a simple base model environment for a ROS differential drive robot with <br>
a laser scanner, IMU and 3D camera. <br> <br>

This model is meant to be a quick starting foundation for different ground robotics projects.<br>
The different sensors already installed make it easy to work with.<br>
