# ROS_base_diff_drive
This is a simple base model environment for a ROS differential drive robot with <br>
a laser scanner, IMU and 3D camera. <br> 

This model is meant to be a quick starting foundation for my multiple ground robotics projects.<br>
The different sensors already installed make it a great starting point.<br>
